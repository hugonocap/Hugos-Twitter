# Twitter Clone

## About App
This is my twitter clone in which you can register an account to post tweets and also view the tweets of other people registered in my application!
I created the interface using SwiftUI and a little bit of UIKit. The application has a FireBase cloud storage in which it stores all the data of registered users.
